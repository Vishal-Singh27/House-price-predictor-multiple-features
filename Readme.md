# 🏠 House Price Predictor (One Feature)

This is a simple implementation of **Linear Regression** from scratch using Python and NumPy. It predicts house prices based on a single feature: **house size**.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python 🐍
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

---

## 📈 What the Project Does
- Uses **gradient descent** to train a linear regression model.
- Trains the model on a small dataset of house sizes and prices.
- Visualizes the predictions using `matplotlib`.
